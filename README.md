# Designing-INS-GNSS-integrated-navigation-systems-by-using-IPO-algorithms
In this paper, an attempt is made to leverage on novel metaheuristic optimization approaches for designing integrated navigation systems. For this purpose, a simplified version of the inclined planes system optimization (called SIPO) algorithm
